CHANGES, beta3:

Added recordCounter and recordTotal in PHP in cObject, CONTENT + RECORDS
Little change in dblayout: nl2br on sysnote output.
Changes made in ti_inc, transferdata and exportdata so that a foreign_table may be "pages"
fixed error in save.html
changes t3lib/page.php/checkRecord so that the row is returned if it exists
added function getCurrentVal() to tslib/content.php
fixed bug that prevented pagecontent from being properly previewed.
Fixed things with the multimedia element, add asf and mpg as videoextensions.
Modified tslib/content.php/makelinks function (3/12)
Modified TEXT-menues so that links are blurred by default if clicked (that means no dashes lines around the links!). "noBlur" option can disable this.
added config-property ATagParams which is included in the end of all typo generated links (except menus)
added isInList property for the if. object in TypoScript
changed order of libraries included in tslib/pagegen.php
tce_main changed so that the order tables are processed always starts with the pages-table.
fixed bug with the preview function which prevented it from working with framesets and rewrite-rule (index_ts.php)
fixed bug in t3lib/tce_main.php that made fileattachment errors duplicate the filereferences in the record.
corrected formerly line 1896 in tslib/content.php for regex-bug (added slashes to {}). (function linkWrap). Error on some installations...
changed the FORM-cObject in TypoScript so that it automatically includes any submitted data into the forms again if eg. data is submitted to the same search-form. 
added property "excludeUidList" to HMENU cObject in TypoScript: Option for excluding specific pages from menus. Smart for excluding pages in menus on certain treelevels like not linking to the frontpage in the menu from... the frontpage itself.
fixed tslib/content.php/substituteSubpart() to substitute recursively if there are more than just the first subpart. 
fixed t3lib/page.php/checkRecord() to check differently.
added new function tslib/content.php/substituteMarkerArray() 
fized meta-tag object in TypoScript to use "name" attribute instead of http-equiv
Changed the "calender" labels to "calendar"
Changed $maxUploadFileSize in t3lib/extfilefunctions.php from 1900 kb to 10000 kb.
Modified various stuff with GET_URL_ID_TOKEN and a fix for removing the "?" after links with no further arguments
Introduced TYPO#_CONF_VARS global array for configuration and removed the original global vars (THIS MAY NEED TO BE UPDATED IN SOME SCRIPTS and in localconf.php!!)
