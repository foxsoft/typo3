Changelog beta2p1:

Fixed bug in tslib/content.php/substituteSubpart()
Fixed bug in tslib/index_ts.php where REDIRECT_URL created trouble with PHP as Apache CGI. Now Typo3 should work out fine with PHP as CGI with Apache. REQUEST_URI is now used to fetch the original scriptname instead of REDIRECT_URL
Substituted al occurencies of $SCRIPT_FILENAME with $HTTP_ENV_VARS["PATH_TRANSLATED"] for PHP as CGI to work properly.
Added "noTrimWrap"-property to stdWrap function
Added "params"-property to tableStyle function
Including typo3conf/localconf.php in typo3/thumbs.php and using $PATH_ImageMagick_LWZ (and PATH_ImageMagick if no PATH_ImageMagick_LWZ) for the creation of thumbnails.
Added "wav,mp3,mov,avi" to the list of fileextensions for the media-field in table tt_content. Allows for filelinks to these filetypes.
Fixed bug in stdlib/htmlmail, function fixrollovers
Added $GLOBALS["typo_db_extTableDef_script"] as an oppotunity to define a script filename in the typo3conf/-folder to include right after having included "tables.php". This provides a way to extend the table- and module definitions without sacrificing the use of the standard distributed tables.php
Added support for previewing pages when hidden. You must refer directly to the page with eg. "?id=23". Do this by chosing "View" in the clickmenu of a page in the Typo3 backend interface. Does not work if a page is also timed by start/stop dates!
Fixed bug with "jumpurl"-functionality when used with "mailto:" prepended emails in text. Also added config-option for disabling jumpurl and jumpurl for mailto only (the last should be used with MSIE5.5 for some reason!)
Added property "colRelations" to IMGTEXT
Added a new item to the "special"-feature of HMENU which may be used to generate menus of the most recently updated pages on a site.
Added property "strftime" to stdWrap plus "locale" to "config" 
The fact that the Typo3 interface remembers the last used url of each module is now disabled, due to some inconviniences.
Think I managed to fix odd MSIE bug in db_layout (some basic text output almost looked like binary stuff). We'll see...
Added treeLevel-condition to templates.
