NOTE: This is a dump of www.typo3.com/?1151
You should see this page for the latest updates, if any.



CHANGES beta1->beta2:


- Default maxWInText is changed from 70% to 50%. This gives a better default size of images when position to the left or right of bodytext. May be overridden by "styles.content.imgtext.maxWInText".  
- Hiddenfields in forms are now positioned in the beginning of a form and not in the end.  
- Redirect-field in forms only set if the action submits to an "external" script (and not index.php)  
- dot_clea.gif is removed. Substituted by "clear.gif" - same file, no duplicates anymore.  
- support for apache ReWrite for simulating static documents (recommended for use with search engines!)  
- support for using "virtual subdirs" (like "virtual hosts") in typo3. Done by creating a symlink to the directory.  
- shortend the lenght of filenames for temporary files (32 chars to 10 chars - should be enough, but it saves a little bandwidth...)  
- Use of cookies to track users is not required. GET-method is used to keep a session, which makes user-logins work with WAP-devices and other non-cookie browsers  
- The QuickGuide section in the help-module is now static documents grabbed with Teleport Pro from the typo3.com website.  
- The library tslib/stdgraphic is moved(!) to t3lib instead as it's used in the backend scripts also. IF ANYONE HAS USED THIS LIBRARY you must change the include-path!!! (Sorry for this inconvenience)  
- New submodule is added to the web-tab. "Page" is it called and it works with the standard-database in Typo3.  
- Lots of other stuff, primarily internal changes. I'm sorry that everything didn't find it's way to this list. It will by the next upgrade, I promise! 




HOW TO UPGRADE YOUR STANDARD SITE FROM BETA1:


You need to follow these steps to upgrade your standard Typo3 beta1 site (eg. the original testsite) to beta2: 




0: INSTALL BETA2 
(See INSTALL.txt)



1: BACKUP: 

First of all you take a backup of: 
- The directory with you site in (in particular the "uploads/" dir is important!!) 
- The database you use 




2: THE DATABASE: 

Some fields in the database changes between versions. Normally a few field types changes and a lot of new fields are added. Possibly a new table is also created. 
The changes are distributed in a SQL-file located in the library base dir ("typo3_src-[xxx]") 

Go to the library base dir and upgrade your old database with this command (one line!!) 

cat beta1_to_beta2_update.sql | mysql --user=[username] --password=[pass] [name_of_database]


Also upgrade the static table "static_template", which is a library of default TypoScript code. Between versions some code is updated and new code is added. The policy is that this table is only expanded with new records so you should be able to safely upgrade! 

zcat static_template+adt-beta2.sql.gz | mysql --user=[username] --password=[password] [name_of_database]





3: THE FILES: 

The file "tables.php" normally changes with each new version. This file reflects the fields in the database, so if the database changes, "tables.php" changes also. This file also contains the language-specific labels for the fields, so any language-update to Typo3 will also result in a new "tables.php". 

Copy the file "tables.php" from the library base dir to the typo3conf/-dir of you Typo3-site


Now go to the base-dir of you Typo3-site. Due to some redesign in beta2, you may remove the softlink to "formmail.php" and "dot_clea.gif". They are not used anymore. (The task of "formmail.php" is done by tslib/index_ts.php now and "dot_clea.gif" is identical to "clear.gif") 

rm formmail.php 
rm dot_clea.gif


Finally you should clear the temp-folder "typo3temp/" which is full files with strange names. This is all the graphics that Typo3 generates when requested. It's always a good idea to clear this folder when a new version is installed. But remember, whenever you clear this folder you must also clear the cache-tables in the database!! 

Delete the content of the temp-folder "typo3temp/".  
I'm not gonna write the command here! Be careful...






4: CHECK THE SITE 

Now log in into typo3 as an admin-user. You'll have to make a few changes here. 
First of all, clear all cached information: 

Go to the "Doc"-module and select "Clear all cache" in the menu.


Now you should browse around on your website. Everything is a bit slow at this point, because all information is cleared from the cache-tables and the graphics are re-generated. 
Check however that everythings looks like it should. If it does, you have successfully installed the beta2 of Typo3. 

Celebrate with a cup of coffee now... 






5: CHANGE USER-SETUP 

Typo3 has been added a new, powerful module which focuses on the management of page-content. This module is by default disabled for users. So you should enable it for the users you would like to access this module - which are probably all users you have... 
Another issue - much worse but at the same time very good - is that nearly all fields in the "tables.php" has been marked for exclusion in beta2! I'll get back to this. 

Make sure you're logged in as an admin-user: 

- Click the root-level of the page-tree and edit the user-groups in question. 
- In the module-list add the module "web_layout"



... and now the excludefields. Here's the explanation: 

Excludefields are fields in the tables which are by default hidden for non-admin users. In order to access these fields, the user must have specific access to the field. 
In beta2 most fields from the standard database is marked for exclusion (in tables.php). This means that you can be more restrictive to what users will see and access in the tables. In other words you specifically assign access to eg. tt_content:text_color if the users of a given usergroup is supposed to change text-color. Otherwise they'll not even know this feature exists! 
This is good. But it also means that you must add these excludefields to the current access-lists for be_groups if they are supposed to access the exact same fields as before. 

For your information, this is the complete list of fields, that has been marked for exclusion. If any of these fields were vital for the usergroups in Typo3, you should add these fields to the list of non-exclude-fields. 

After you have done this, you should login as one of your users and check that everything is OK.

6: Other things to do? 

Replace any occurencies of "dot_clea.gif" in your templates, if you have used this file. If you chose not to remove it, just ignore this.  
 If you run Typo3 in a subfolder of a domain, eg. "www.something.com/typo3_pages/" and use the "Domain"-records to create sections on your website, add the "path" to the domain in the record (enter: "www.something.com/typo3_pages/" instead of just "www.something.com")  
 If you use the library "tslib/stdgraphic.php" in some of your own php-scripts, please notice that this library has changed it's location to "t3lib/stdgraphic.php"
