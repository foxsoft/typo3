URW (Unternehmensberatung Rubow Weber, from the founders' names), in Hamburg, Germany, produces font software (notably, the IKARUS font design system), fonts, and logos. They offer at least eleven font CD ROMs, some with 500 or more typefaces, and also sell font CD ROMs produced by other font vendors. 
A list of 4291 font names in several CD ROM distributions is available. 

URW also very kindly contributed freely-distributable Type 1 fonts to Aladdin Enterprises for use with the Ghostscript PostScript interpreter, thereby providing high-quality outline fonts for the fonts commonly available in PostScript printers.
