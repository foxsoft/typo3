CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between TYPO3 4.0 and 4.1
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

Compatibility
=============

	* captionSplit.cObject had been removed in version 4.0. For compatibility reasons, it has been added again, though it remains deprecated and should not be used anymore (bug #3005)
	* In TYPO3 4.0, showpic.php automatically adds default parameters to custom URLs. Some extensions did not like this feature because they want to generate all parameters by themselves. Enabling JSwindow.altUrl_noDefaultParams will now solve this problem for them (bug #1153)
	* FORM submit buttons with images are now valid xhtml (bug #3397)

Installation/Upgrade
====================

	* The update wizard has been slightly reworded to make the functionality more easy to understand (bug #3943)

====

	* Improved support for Oracle
	* ADOdb has been updated to version 4.90
