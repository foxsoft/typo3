************************************************************************
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between TYPO3 4.0 and 4.1
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

General
==================

	* New PHP version requirement: You need to have at least PHP 4.3.0 in order to run TYPO3 4.1

Backend
==================

	* Inline Relational Record Editing (IRRE)
		-> It's now possible to create and edit child records of a record as subforms inside of the form view in the backend
		-> Therefore, the new TCA field type "inline" has been introduced
		-> See http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Inline_Relational_Record_Editing for details

	* Bidirectional MM relations: It's now possible to configure MM relations from both sides of the relation.
		-> E.g. an employment relation could now be edited from both the "person" as well as the "company" side. ("employers" of "persons" and "employees" of "companies")

	* BE who-is-online
		-> The Tools->Useradmin module now displays which BE users are currently online.

	* UTF-8 for filenames
		-> You need to set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['UTF8filesystem'] to TRUE to enable this feature.

	* Improved Extension Manager
		-> Requires less memory
		-> The EM now stores the list of extensions from TER in the database,
		-> see http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=2615

	* Two nice usability enhancements
		-> Using <label> tags in tceforms where appropriate to enhance usability in the Backend forms
		-> Increase length for titles of be_users, be_groups, and fe_groups

Compatibility
=============

	* Changed the default value of $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[SYS][devIPmask]

Speed improvements
==================

	* TODO Dmitry: explain cache_pagesection speedup

	* TODO Dmitry: explain speedup using .htaccess

Development
====================

	* Better getRecordTitle() function
		-> It's now possible to define a "label_userFunc"
		-> This makes it possible to e.g. define the label of a "persons" table as displayed in the list module to be like "Lastname, Firstname". Until now you could only define one field to be the "labelfield".

	* Inline Relational Record Editing (see "Backend" section above)

Database changes
================

	* Changed many BLOB fields from int/varchar/whatever to tinyint(1) - this is the field type which is actually intended by MySQL for BLOBs

DBAL
====

	* ...

Frontend features
=================

	* Autologin for Frontend users is now possible!
		-> Users can decide on their own whether they want to "Stay logged in" using a checkbox. The latest version of the "newloginbox" extension is required for that.
		-> Needs to be configured in the Install Tool ("All Configuration" -> "permalogin" and "lifetime")

	* UTF-8 for log files
		-> TYPO3 now logs page paths in UTF-8 if config.stat_apache_niceTitle is set to "utf-8" in the TypoScript template Setup.

	* Enable $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[FE][pageNotFoundOnCHashError] by default
		-> URLs (especially plugins) can contain the &cHash parameter. It contains a checksum of the whole paramter set and is very useful for caching.
		-> In the past, a wrong cHash caused the website to be recreated with caching turned off.
		-> With the new behaviour, a wrong cHash will instead trigger an error message since this usually should never happen!
		-> Usually, the cHash is only wrong if a) someone has changed the encryptionKey (bad!) or b) someone has manually modified the requested URL

Backend skin
