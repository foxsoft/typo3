************************************************************************
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between TYPO3 4.2 and 4.3
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

General
==================

	* ...

Backend
==================

	* Extension Manager: You can now set a new option "excludeFromUpdates" in every
	  every extensions' ext_emconf.php array. This way, it is a) not shown in the
	  list of extensions to update and b) is shown a exclamation mark in order to
	  prevent updates for this extension. This is very useful if you made local changes
	  to an extension and don't want any admin to overwrite them.


Compatibility
=============

	* ...

Speed improvements
==================

	* ...

Frontend
==================

	* The message log of the admin panel will report failures to set the locale
	* Integrated functionality of extension jb_status_code into core:
	  It is now possible to specify a redirection code (301, 302, 303 or
	  307) together with a domain redirection in a sys_domain record.

Development
====================

	* ...

TypoScript changes
==================

	* t3lib_div::makeInstance now supports singletons. To mark a class as a
	  singleton it must implement the t3lib_singleton interface.

Database changes
================

	* ...

DBAL

Frontend features
=================

	* Frontend plugins now can convert themselves from USER to USER_INT on the fly. This
	  is useful for plugins who can disallow caching using a TSConfig option (for example,
	  tt_news). Earlier plugins had to use $GLOBALS['TSFE']->set_no_cache(), which caused
	  huge performance problems. Now plugin simply need to call
	  $this->cObj->convertToUserIntObject() and return immediately without generating any
	  content.
	  Objects can find their current execution mode by calling $this->cObj->getUserObjectType().
	  This function can return either tslib_cObj::OBJECTTYPE_USER (if object runs as USER)
	  or tslib_cObj::OBJECTTYPE_USER_INT (if object is running as USER_INT). Here the code
	  example:
	  	function main() {
			....
	  		if (!$this->conf['allowCaching'] && $this->cObj->getUserObjectType() == tslib_cObj::OBJECTTYPE_USER) {
				$this->cObj->convertToUserIntObject();
				return '';
			}

	* Class tslib_eidtools is enhanced with new methods for eID/AJAX applications:
		public static function initLanguage($language = 'default');
			Creates $GLOBALS['LANG'] for the given language
		public static function initTCA();
			Loads 'ctrl' sections for TCA tables from all installed extensions
		public static function initExtensionTCA($extensionKey);
			Similar to initTCA() but loads the table only for the given extension

	* Added option named "additionalAbsRefPrefixDirectories" for Frontend in the Install tool.
	  This option is useful if the installation uses non-TYPO3 applications and links to
	  them from extensions. Earlier TYPO3 prepended only media/, typo3conf/ext/ and
	  fileadmin/ directories automatically with config.absRefPrefix. Using the new variable
	  administrators can tell TYPO3 to prepend also other directories inside the site root
	  with config.absRefPrefix.

	* Added new Install tool option named "dbClientCompress". This option will
	  enable MySQL compression for network traffic. This is useful if
	  MySQl is not on the same host as the web server. Do not use this option if MySQL
	  is on the same host because it will only slow down the process. However if MySQL
	  is on the other host, this option may impove performance significally.

Backend skin
