************************************************************************
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS in TYPO3 4.0
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

Installation/Upgrade
====================

	* TYPO3 4.0 ships with an empty typo3/ext folder. Sites which depend on them must reinstall this extensions.
	* TYPO3 4.0 uses a new localization scheme (typo3conf/l10n/). To install language packs use the extension managers function for translation handling. (Exensions csh_<language> are obsolete!)
	* TYPO3 4.0  doesn't need symbolic links anymore (on Unix systems); no more duplicate files (on Windows systems)
	* Existing symbolic links from index.php to <TYPO3_root>/tslib/index_ts.php must be changed to <TYPO3_src>/index.php (Unix).
	* The symbolic links from nimbus.ttf and vera.ttf to arial.ttf and verdana.ttf have been removed. If you need those fonts create the symbolic links manually (Unix) or copy the fonts (Windows).

New features
============

	* Workspaces: this new system extension brings offline editing to TYPO3 (using the built-in versioning) - add/change content in a "draft" workspace and publish the changes into the "live" workspace
	* DBAL 1.0: this new system extension offers database independence (currently working with Oracle and PostgreSQL)
	* The 1-2-3 quick install has been enhanced
	* a new update wizard of the installer handles compatibility issues
	* the new default RTE (rtehtmlarea) is compatible with more browsers and operating systems (Firefox, Opera; Linux, BSD, Mac OS X)
	* "sliding" of content elements similar to TypoScript's getText level* feature (integration of extension "kb_cont_slide" by Bernhard Kraft)
	* User admin module: switch back to admin user after user switch (SU-mode), "create new user" link
	* System log (eg DB errors; configured via $CONF_VARS['SYS']['systemLog']
	* Sharing of sessions between subdomains (configured via $CONF_VARS['SYS']['domainCookie'])

Improvements
============

	* the undo and history feature has been enhanced: rollback/preview on page and record level; history includes now inserts and deletes
	* improved indexed search (template support, faster) - many thanks to Udo von Eynern for implementing the template support!
	* the page type "external link" supports HTTPS (thanks to Marc Bastian Heinrichs)
	* the extension manager has been overhauled and benefits from new enhancements of TER 2.0
	* the GIFBUILDER objects may create true colour images (PNG and JPEG)
	* typolinks and HMENUs (type "language") may preserve the query parameters

Usability
=========

	* pages can be moved by drag and drop within the page tree (thanks to Stephane Schitter)
	* faster context menues (implemented with AJAX)
	* fixed fonts are used in BE configuration fields for increased readability

	* files can be created or uploaded with buttons in the Web>List content frame
	* improved content element wizard (eg empty categories are removed)
	* RTE wizard has now a save-and-close button
	* the admin panel uses HTTP GET instead of POST (no more browser warnings when reloading a previewed page)

Access Control
==============

	* FE-groups may now be nested (integration of extension "fenestgrp" by Glenn Gibb)
	* pages and content elements can have more than one group assigned (integration of extension "ingmar_accessctrl" by Ingmar Schlecht)

Security
=========

	* New option for lockSSL: get redirected to standard http after BE login with SSL

Accessibility

	* the overall DTD and the XHTML-DTD may be set indepenently (config.docytpe and config.xhtmlDoctype)
	* output of CSS styled content is now accessible by default (mailforms, menus, sitemaps) - many thanks to Ernesto Baschny, kudos also to Sebastian Kurfuerst and Michael Stucki
	* images have accessibility features (integration of extension "cron_cssstyledimgtext" by Ernesto Baschny)
	* the "table" content element has now limited accessibility support (integration of extension "accessible_tables" by Rupert Germann)

Configuration
=============

	* the new := assignment for Typoscript allows now parse time maniplation of TS values (eg "obj.val := appendString(foobar)", "obj.list := addToList(3,5,9)")
	* TypoScript conditions may be combined with OR and AND

API
===

	* loading of scripts into the default URL with index.php?eID=<key> (using this feature showpic.php has been removed from the TYPO3 root directory)
	* TCA form fields may have custom PHP and Javascript evaluation (thanks to Thomas Hempel)
	* TCA form fields may be set to readonly (HTML attribute)
	* TCA fields of type "none" have new rendering options (date and other formats)
	* Direct mail has been removed from the core (t3lib/class.t3lib_dmailer.php)
