You need to create and set at least one filemount with a folder \'_temp_\' in it if you want users to upload files through the webbrowser.
Filemounts may also configure access to a path on the server to which the user has FTP-access. Just remember to set file-permissions on the server correctly so the webserver user (which PHP is running as) has at least read access to the FTP-dir.',

If BASE is absolute you should enter the absolute path on the server, eg. "/home/ftp_upload" or "C:/home/ftp_upload". 

<strong>Notice:</strong> In any case, make sure the webserver user which PHP is running as has <em>at least</em> read-access to the path. If not, the mount will simply not appear without any warnings. 
If you have problems - especially with absolute mounts - try to mount something "simple" like a relative path in fileadmin. If that is working well, try the absolute path.

Your PHP-configuration may also impose other restrictions on you if safe-mode like features are enabled. Then use relative paths.',
