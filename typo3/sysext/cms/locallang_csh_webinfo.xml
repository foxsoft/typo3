			<label index="pagetree_overview.alttitle">Pagetree Overview</label>
			<label index="pagetree_overview.description">The Pagetree Overview shows information related to pages for a branch of the page tree. This includes record counts, page settings like alias, start- and stop-times, cache settings etc.</label>

			<label index="_pagetree_overview.image">EXT:cms/cshimages/pagetree_overview_1.png</label>
			<label index="pagetree_overview.image_descr">One of the features of the Pagetree Overview module is that you can see what types of records are found on pages in a branch. Here record counts are shown for a page tree branch 2 levels down.</label>
			<label index="func_0.alttitle">Basic Settings</label>
			<label index="func_0.description">Displays a selection of fields from page records which are regarded as foundational settings for pages. That includes aliases, start- and stop times, access restriction information etc.</label>
			<label index="func_0.details">The Basic Settings view resembles the Cache and Age view quite a lot. They are different only by the selection of fields they show.

&lt;b&gt;Batch editing page fields&lt;/b&gt;
You will find multiple edit-icons around the interface. All edit icons in head lines will bring you to an editing dialog where you can change exactly that field for all listed tables! Very useful for batch-editing of say all &quot;Start&quot; times.
If you click the edit icon at the ID numbers of pages you will get straight to the regular editing of a whole page record.</label>

			<label index="func_0.image_descr">The Basic Settings view. Notice how this offers a very convenient overview of page aliases, start times and access restriction settings in the tree branch.
If you click an edit-icon in the header you will be able to edit that field (here the &quot;Access&quot; field) for all listed pages.
This is how batch-editing looks like; Only one field per record!</label>
			<label index="func_1.alttitle">Record Overview</label>
			<label index="func_1.description">Record overview gives you an indispensable overview of the distribution of records in the page tree. Each database table in the system is represented with a column and for each page you can see the number of records from that table located on the page.</label>
			<label index="func_1.details">&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; Be careful with the level-setting. Setting for instance &quot;3 levels&quot; might make the module respond very slowly if there are many pages and many records in the database as well!

&lt;b&gt;Tree stop?&lt;/b&gt;
Notice the red &quot;+&quot; next to a page in the page tree? This is due to a setting for that page record which means that the page tree will not expand for this page. Typically this is set for protection when there are a large amount of subpages underneath (hundreds of pages typically). If you click the icon/title the overview will jump to make this page the new root of the overview.</label>

			<label index="_func_1.image">EXT:cms/cshimages/pagetree_overview_6.png</label>
			<label index="func_1.image_descr">Notice how you can easily see the distribution of Content Elements on a page. You can also see where Template Records - and basically any record! - are located in the page tree!</label>
			<label index="func_2.alttitle">Cache and Age</label>
			<label index="func_2.description">Displays a selection of fields from page records related to page caching and time settings.</label>

			<label index="func_2.image_descr">The &quot;Cache and Age&quot; view.
Here you see the &quot;TSconfig&quot; column. The overview exposes that these two pages include some Page TSconfig code!</label>
			<label index="stat.alttitle">Page Hit statistics</label>
			<label index="stat.description">Displays website hit statistics for a branch of the page tree. Based on the simple, internal MySQL statistics table which records page impressions and sessions only.</label>
			<label index="stat.details">&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt; This function requires the extension &quot;Simple hit statistics&quot; (sys_stat) to be installed. Also you must configure TypoScript to register page hits in the statistics database table.</label>
			<label index="_stat.image">EXT:cms/cshimages/pagetree_overview_3.png</label>
			<label index="func_hits.alttitle">Statistic Views</label>
			<label index="func_hits.description">You can select between three views of the statistics in the selector box; &quot;Page hits&quot;, &quot;Total hits&quot;, &quot;Hits in main sections&quot;. Use the right selector box to select the depth of the overview in the pagetree.</label>
			<label index="func_hits.details">You can view the page hit statistics 30 days back. Each day is shown in its own column.
For each page in the page tree you can see the page hits each day as a number formatted like [page hits]/[user sessions]. So if the number is &quot;286/34&quot; it means that the page had 286 page hits that day and that there were at least 34 unique visitors (measured by at least two hits by a user accepting a cookie from the site).

This is an overview of the meaning of each view mode:

&lt;b&gt;Page hits&lt;/b&gt;
This shows page hits/sessions for each page.

&lt;b&gt;Total hits&lt;/b&gt;
This will show statistics only for pages that has a Template Record (with Root-flag set) on it. This means that page hits are shown as totals for a whole website.

&lt;b&gt;Hits in main sections&lt;/b&gt;
Will show the total number of page hits/sessions within main sections of a website. A &quot;main section&quot; is all subpages to a page on the first level of a website (defined by a Template Record with the Root flag set).</label>
